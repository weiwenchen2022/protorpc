# protoc-gen-go-netrpc

This tool generates Go language bindings of `service`s in protobuf definition
files for net/rpc.

## Future-proofing services

By default, to register services using the methods generated by this tool, the
service implementations must embed the corresponding
`Unimplemented<ServiceName>Server` for future compatibility.
To turn off this behavior, set the option `require_unimplemented_servers=false`.
E.g.:

```
  protoc --go-netrpc_out=. --go-netrpc_opt=require_unimplemented_servers=false[,other options...] \
```

Note that this is not recommended.
